# Django Learning and Project Proposal

## Objective
To build upon the foundational knowledge of Django CRUD by exploring advanced concepts and practical project development. This will provide a deeper understanding of Django's capabilities and real-world application.



## Project Ideas to Work On Together

### 1. **Blog with Tags & Comments**
   Build a multi-user blog with features such as tags, categories, and comments. Add markdown rendering and rich text editing for posts.

### 2. **E-commerce Store**
   Create a simple e-commerce platform where users can browse, add products to their cart, and complete the checkout process. Integration with payment gateways is a potential feature to explore.

### 3. **Task Management App**
   Develop an app where users can manage tasks, set deadlines, prioritize, and track the status of tasks. Add features like task sharing between users.

### 4. **Social Media-like App**
   Build a basic social media platform with user relationships, posting, following, and commenting. This can include a dynamic content feed for each user.

### 5. **Real-Time Chat App**
   Use Django Channels to build a real-time chat application. This would provide exposure to WebSockets and real-time application development.

### 6. **Event Booking System**
   Create a system for users to browse, book, and manage events. Add payment processing and user reviews for a complete booking system.

### 7. **Survey/Poll App**
   Develop an app where users can create and participate in surveys or polls. Real-time result visualization and data export functionality can be included.

### 8. **Portfolio or Personal Website**
  Create a portfolio or personal website to showcase projects, skills, and contact information. This project will also help with the studentâ€™s personal branding.
